Certainly! Utilizing the `fetch` API in JavaScript allows you to make HTTP requests to RESTful APIs and handle responses. Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `fetch` API to consume a REST service in a React component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FetchAPIComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error('Network response was not ok.');
        }
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Data from API</h2>
      <ul>
        {data.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
          // Display specific data properties, adjust as per API response structure
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default FetchAPIComponent;
```

Explanation:
- The `FetchAPIComponent` uses React hooks, `useState` and `useEffect`, to manage state and perform side effects respectively.
- Inside the `useEffect` hook, an asynchronous function `fetchData` is defined to make a GET request to the API endpoint using `fetch`.
- Replace `'https://api.example.com/data'` with the actual URL of the REST API endpoint you want to consume.
- The `fetch` function makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL. Upon a successful response (status 200-299), it reads the response body as JSON using `response.json()` and updates the component state with the received data using `setData`.
- The component then renders the fetched data, assuming it's an array of objects with properties like `id` and `name`.

Remember to handle errors and adapt the code based on your API's response structure and requirements. Additionally, consider handling loading states or adding error boundaries for better user experience.
